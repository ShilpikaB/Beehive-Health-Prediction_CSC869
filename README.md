# Background
Q1. Why bees are important?
- A third of the world's food production depends on bees.
- Major pollinators.

Q2. Problem
- Declining bee population.
- Mites and ants infestation.
- Frequent check-ups on the hive is desirable to monitor the hive strength and health.
- Manual investigation of beehives is time intensive and often distrupts the beehive environment.

# Motivation & Objective
How can we help ?
- Improve the ability to understand the hive health without checking for the hive manually.
- Devise a non-invasive hive health checkup technique using ML.
- Studies show that honeybee images flying in/out of the hive can be used to make inferences about the hive health.
- Use convolutional neural network (CNN) to design ML models to predict hive health.
- Assess the models for their performances.

# Dataset Description
- Our dataset contains 5100+ bee images annotated with location, date, time, subspecies, health condition, caste, and pollen.
